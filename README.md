Telecom Churn: Retaining High-Value Customers

Customer churn - switching providers - plagues the telecom industry, with annual rates of 15-25%. Acquiring new customers is expensive, so retention is critical. This project focuses on a leading telecom firm in India/Southeast Asia, where prepaid plans are common.

We'll analyze customer data to predict churn risk among high-value customers (defined later), who contribute 80% of revenue. By identifying churn indicators and building churn prediction models, we can help the company retain these valuable customers.

Challenge: Defining churn for prepaid users who might simply pause service, not necessarily switch providers. We'll use a usage-based churn definition focusing on recent inactivity.
